# ZEV Fleet Dashboard

This project is a web-based dashboard for exploring fleet data related to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Pennsylvania. It visualizes fleet locations on a map and shows detailed information about each fleetâ€™s vehicles and chargers. The goal is to help users, such as DEP staff or researchers, understand the makeup and distribution of ZEV fleets across the state.

## How the App Is Structured

- `app.py`: Entry point that launches the Dash multi-page app
- `pages/...`: Contains pages for each dashboard view:
  - `overview.py`: Landing page
  - `fleet_info.py`: Fleet map and details
  - `charging.py`: Charger usage and types
  - `telematics.py`: Telematics and trip summaries
  - `veh_daily_usage.py`: Daily usage per vehicle
  - `analysis.py`: Summary analysis and visualizations
- `db.py`: Functions to load data from PostgreSQL (fleets, vehicles, chargers, etc.)
- `utils.py`: Stores mappings for vehicle and charger types and helper functions
- `assets/...`: Contains assets:
  - `background.png`: Background picture for the overview page
  - `pa_boundary.geojson`: GeoJSON file used to draw the Pennsylvania state boundary on the map

> The project uses `dash`, `dash-bootstrap-components`, `dash-leaflet`, `pandas`, and `sqlalchemy`.
